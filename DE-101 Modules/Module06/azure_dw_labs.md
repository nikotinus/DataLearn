# Overview
## Introduction
In this course, you will learn concepts, strategies, and best practices for designing a cloud-based data warehousing solution using Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse, the
petabyte-scale data warehouse in Azure. We will demonstrate how to collect, store, and prepare data for the data warehouse by using other Azure services. We will also
explore how to use business intelligence (BI) and ETL tools to perform analysis on your data and integration. This course will help you to understand the fundamental
principles of Cloud Analytics and learn core functionality of Azure SQL DW and Azure Data Platform ecosystem.
## Data Set
We will use the following data sets:
- Microsoft SQL Server AdventureWorks database that is deploying with Azure SQL Data Warehouse
- Sample TXT file with sales information
- Sample logs files
## Course Outline
We will have four labs during workshop. We will cover the following topics:
- Getting started with Azure SQL DW - provision cluster of DW and connecting it with SQL client.
- Learn about Azure SQL DW design principles and available distribution methods as well as other techniques that helps to  optimize performance of DW.
- Try Azure Data Factory and will load data into DW as well as use Polybase and create external table.
- We will use Power BI desktop and connect Azure SQL DW.
## Credits
Course was prepared based on technical knowledge of Rock Your Data team in Cloud Data Warehousing, Microsoft documentation, Microsoft Training Materials and online Microsoft courses on Edx.org. 

# Lab 01: Provision Azure DW
In this lab, we will provision Azure Synapse Data Warehouse (Ex-SQL Data Warehouse) (DW) using Microsoft Azure Portal. Moreover, we will connect Azure SQL DW using Azure Data Studio.
Finally, we will run SQL queries.
